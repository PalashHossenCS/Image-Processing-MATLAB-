# Image-Processing-MATLAB-
This repository contains MATLAB implementations of various image processing techniques as part of a laboratory project. These include image conversions, bit plane slicing, histogram specification, Fourier transforms, and morphological operations.

## Features

### 1. Image Conversion
- Convert indexed images to grayscale, RGB, and HSI (approximated with HSV).

### 2. Bit Plane Slicing
- Extract and visualize the bit planes (from LSB to MSB) of an image.
- Modify images by setting LSB or MSB to zero.

### 3. Mirror View Image
- Generate a horizontally flipped version of an image to create a mirror effect.

### 4. Histogram Specification
- Match the histogram of an image to a reference image for enhanced visual similarity.

### 5. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Compute and display the magnitude spectrum of the FFT of a grayscale image.

### 6. Morphological Operations
- Apply erosion, dilation, opening, and closing operations on binary and grayscale images.
